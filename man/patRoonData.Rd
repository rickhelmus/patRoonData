exampleDataPath(polarity = "positive")

exampleAnalysisInfo(polarity = "positive")
}
\arguments{
\item{polarity}{Either \code{"positive"} or \code{"negative"}.}

\description{
A small set of LC-HRMS data to test and demonstrate the functionality of patRoon.
}
\details{
This package contains data files from (1) a standard mixture containing various polar contaminants and (2) a blank
solvent. Both were analysed in triplicate, using an Shimadzu Nexera UHPLC coupled to an high resolution quadrupole
time of flight instrument (Bruker maXis 4G Q-TOF) using positive and negative electrospray ionization.

To reduce file sizes, the data has been filtered to only contain the first ten minutes of the chromatographic run
with \emph{m/z} 75-500. The complete data processing script can be
found in data-raw/process.R

\code{exampleDataPath} is a helper function that returns the file path of the example data.

\code{exampleAnalysisInfo} is a helper function that generate analysis information that can be directly used
  by \pkg{patRoon}.
